Hi Professor

When you told us to do an app for the project, I was confused. But
later when you told that the people with no background in computer science can pick
any other one related to security, I did a lot of research on what I can do. I
then realized that instead of putting efforts on looking for what to do, why not put
those efforts on building an app and learn something new. So I've decided to do
this project. Even though I have a little knowledge about it for now, I look forward
to make it a bigger one.

Thanks and Regards
